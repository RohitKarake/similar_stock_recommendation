INE266A01019~Pharmaceuticals~Smithkline Beecham Pharmaceuticals Ltd(Merged)~162~162~"Smithkline Beecham Pharma (SKBP), formerly Eskayef, was formed in 1984 to acquire the business of the Indian branch of Eskaylab, UK. The company started its operations in India under the name Menley & James, which was changed to Smithkline & French (India) in 1960 and then to Eskaylab in 1981. The company has a collaboration with Smithkline Beecham, UK, which has a 40% stake in the company and it changed its name from Eskayef to Smithkline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (India) in Jul.'94.

Glaxo Wellcome plc and SmithKline plc have merged under an agreement which became effective on 27 Dec 2000. They now form a new company called GlaxoSmithKline plc. So SKBP has now become the associate of GlaxoSmithKline plc and will be merged with Glaxo India. 

The scheme of amalgamation has been approved and exchange ratio has been fixed at one share of Glaxo India for two shares of SKBP.

SKBP's product line includes leading brands like Iodex, Engeric B, Fefol-Z, Augmentin, Zentel, Zevit, Ditide and Depandal-M. The company has a substantial presence in respiratory, iron preparation, anti-infective skin preparation, anti-helemintics, anti-allergies, oral polio and multi-vitamins. 

The Top 7 brands of the company are among the Top 250 brands of India. Iodex, the pain balm, is the largest brand of the company. Augmentin is the top brand in the co-amoxyclav category. 

The different brands and vaccines of the company in different segments are given below: 

Iodex accounts for around 18% of SKBP's formulation sales. Over the years, it has become a virtual OTC product. Line extensions like Iodex Sport, Iodex Spray and Iodex Power, a focus on the rural market, sales by means of pouches, etc. will drive growth of this brand. 

Augmentin is an anti-infective in the co-amoxyclav class and the parent company's globally renowned anti-infective. Over the last year, the product has grown by over 25% and is likely to continue at this pace in the medium-term future as well. The brand has an annual sales close to Rs 40 crore. 

The growth was propelled by the launch of Augmentin Duo, twice a day dosage, which ensures better compliance and lower therapy cost. 

SKBP is a pioneer in India as far as Hepatitis B goes. However, SKBP faces low-cost competition from local players like Shantha Biotech- Pfizer, Cadilla, Wockhardt and Alkem. To top that, the government imposed a 38.5% import duty on the same. 

SKBP, which was importing the product directly from its group company in Belgium, took a massive hit while trying to maintain its presence in the market. Of late, SKBP has adopted the strategy of higher volume and lower realization. Moreover, to counter this low-price competition, SKBP launched its multi-clonal vaccines. Thus, to a certain extent, the drop in sales of Engerix has been lost to SKBP's own multi-clonal vaccine. 

The gradual shift in the immunisation market from mono vaccine to combination vaccine is a very good opportunity for the company. The new combination vaccines, Tritanrix HB and Twinrix, will gradually help the company to win back its lost marketshare on account of Engerix B. The combination vaccines provide patients `greater value for money' and at the same time will keep competition away. 

Havrix, Varilrix and Twinrix are three vaccines that are expected to contribute increasingly to the company's earnings in the near future. Havrix, the Hepatitis A vaccine, is targetted at the upper class adult segment . The Hepatitis A vaccine market in India is still at an unexplored stage and SKBP is ready to tap this market. 

The chicken pox vaccine, Varilrix, is expected to do well in the current financial year (FY). The sales of SKBP's newly launched combination vaccine, Twinrix, will surely do well as SKBP is the only player in the combination vaccine market. The other plus point of this vaccine is that this combination vaccine costs less than two other individual vaccines.

manufactured are superfine fabrics,volles, dhoties, mulls sewing threads  and 
yarn under the trade name 'Khatau'.


OPERATIONS  :  In 1981-82, the overall performance was affected  due  to  the 
textile  strike  in Bombay. Other factors which contributed to  this  adverse 
result  were  continuous eacalation in the input  costs, rise  in  wages  and 
power tariffa. The textile strike which started on 18th January, 1982 finally 
fizzled  out towards the end of April 1983. this was soon followed  by  acute 
recesion. The working for 1982-83, therefore, resulted in a loss. In 1983-84, 
in   spite  of  continued  escalation  in  costs,  the  company  achieved   a 
satisfactory  performance.  In  1984-85 (18 months)  and  1986,  the  working 
continued  to  be satisfactory. During 1987, continued  escalation  in  input 
costs coupled with shortage of working funds effected the overall working  of 
the company.

In  1988-89 (15 months), the working results were adversely affected  due  to 
paucity of funds. In 1989-90, the overall working registered some improvement 
mainly  due  to  stable prices of cotton and improved  off-take  of  fabrics. 
During  1990-91,  though sales turnover improved, the working resulted  in  a 
loss due to increase in input costs.

During  1978-79  and  1979-80,  a  sum of  Rs.300  lakhs  was  spent  towards 
modernisation.  Two  diesel generating sets of 1100 KVA  each  were  imported 
during  1979-80 and these were installed in 1980-81. In 1981-82 and  1982-83,

of  Maharashtra  State.  100  acrea of land was  acquired  and  the  work  of 
constructing the compound wall and fencing of the entire plot was  completed. 
It  was  hoped  to complete the first phase of  this  project  involving  the 
installation  of 72 water jet looms along with required  weaving  preparatory 
and  twisting machinery by June 1985 at a cost of Rs.12 crores. during  1983-
84,  the  work  on this project was commenced. During 1984-85,  most  of  the 
machinery was installed and trial production had started. Full production was 
expected  to commence from mid-June 1986. However, due to  unforseen  delays, 
the  project  commenced production only from october 1986.  During  1986,  48 
water  jet  looms were erected and commisioned. The balance of 24  water  jet 
looms  were expected to be eracted and commissioned shortly. 12 Repair  looms 
from Italy were received and were under erection.

RAVALUATION:  During  1983-84, land and buildings of the  Borivli  unit  were

revaluation was transferred to capital reserves.

INE254A01015~Pharmaceuticals~Parke Davis (India) Ltd (Merged)~431~431~"Parke Davis(India)(PDIL) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of consumer healthcare and ethical pharmaceutical products with OTC products constituting about two-thirds of the total sales. 

In the recent past, the American multinational, Pfizer Inc., and Warner Lambert had agreed to a $90-billion merger to create the world's fastest growing pharma company with combined annual revenues of around $28 billion. PDIL is now owned 40% by Warner Lambert Company, US, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Parke Davis & Company, US.

The company had invested Rs 25 cr for promoting two of its flagship brands-- Gelusil and Benadryl-in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. The Drug Controller of India (DCI) has already approved the proposal. These brands are in the antacid and anti-cold segments. The company conducted test trials in select markets in Kolkatta, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Both the formulations are now available in the OTC market all over India. 

The company signed a Memorandum of Intended Transfer in Feb 2000 for the sale of its property at Saki Naka, Mumbai. The sale was completed during the year 2001 for Rs 49.30 cr. Moreover, the company has sold off its assets for which lease agreements have terminated by Warner Lambert (India) for Rs 21.11 cr.

The recent merger of Pfizer and Warner Lambert, may have no direct impact on the local operations but should a merger of local entities also goes through, then Parke Davis could emerge as a major player in the cough syrups segment.

Recently, PDIL's former employees filed petitions alleging that they were forced to accept VRS by the management. The district civil court has ordered attachment of the plant and machinery of the company following petitions filed by former employees. The management, in return, pleaded for a grant of stay order on the attachment proceedings, which was dismissed by the court.

Thus, with this development, the much awaited merger of Pfizer and Parke-Davis in India may get delayed. The merger was likely to be completed by 2002.

During the year 2003, the company amalgamated with Pfizer Ltd., where four equity shares of Pfizer Ltd., will be allotted for every nine existing equity shares of the company held."
